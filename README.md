Yahtzee is a popular dice game known for its combination of luck and strategy. The main objective of Yahtzee is to score points by rolling a set of dice in various combinations to achieve the highest possible total score. Here is the basic game play:

Rolling the dice: each player takes turns rolling the five dice. In the standard game, players have a maximum of three rolls per turn. After the first roll, they can choose to keep some of the dice and re-roll the others. After the second roll, they can again choose to keep some dice and re-roll the rest. After the third roll (or earlier if they choose), they must choose a category to score the roll.
Scoring categories: The scoresheet is divided into several categories, each representing a different combination of dice. Players must choose a category for their roll after their turn is completed. Some common categories include ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, and sixes (where you score the total of the specified number on the dice), as well as other combinations like three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, small straight, large straight, and Yahtzee.
Winning: The game typically consists of 13 rounds (one for each category on the scoresheet). The player with the highest total score at the end of these rounds wins the game.
In this assignment, we will develop a C program that can identify the main scoring categories after rolling the dice. In this simplified version of Yahtzee, users will roll the five dice (which will be randomly generated numbers between 1 and 6) and check if the rolled numbers can be categorized as :

Yahtzee: a Yahtzee is when all five dice show the same number.
Large Straight: a large straight is a sequence of five consecutive numbers on the dice.
Small Straight: a small straight is a sequence of four consecutive numbers on the dice.
Full House: a full house is when you have three dice showing one number and two dice showing another number.
Four of a Kind: a four of a kind is when you have four dice showing one number and one dice showing another number.
Three of a Kind: a three of a kind is when you have three dice showing one number and two dice showing two other (distinct) numbers.
No Play: the numbers on the dice cannot be categorized in any of the above plays.
